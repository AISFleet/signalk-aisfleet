# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Signal K plugin called "AIS Fleet" that monitors AIS (Automatic Identification System) vessels, displays them on an interactive web map, and submits their data to an external API at configurable intervals. Signal K is an open-source data exchange format for marine use.

## Architecture

### Plugin Structure
- `plugin/index.js` - Main plugin implementation
- `public/index.html` - Web interface with Leaflet.js map
- `public/app.js` - Frontend JavaScript for real-time vessel display
- `public/assets/icons/` - Plugin icons
- `package.json` - Signal K plugin metadata and dependencies
- Plugin follows Signal K plugin conventions with start/stop lifecycle and schema configuration

### Key Components
- **Vessel Data Collection**: Uses Signal K subscription manager with proper context filtering
- **Cloud Vessel Integration**: Fetches nearby vessels from AIS Fleet API (100nm radius)
- **Data Management**: Maintains in-memory map of vessel data, auto-removes stale data (>24h)
- **Web Interface**: Interactive Leaflet.js map showing vessels with real-time updates
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time vessel updates via Signal K WebSocket stream
- **Vessel Classification**: Color-coded icons based on AIS vessel type
- **Periodic Operations**: Configurable timer (1-15 minutes) for API submissions and cloud vessel fetching
- **HTTP Client**: Uses axios for REST API communication
- **Update Throttling**: Prevents duplicate processing with 2-second vessel update throttling
- **Delta Injection**: Selective injection of navigation data to Signal K for cloud vessels

### Data Flow

#### Local AIS Data
1. Subscribe to all Signal K contexts using subscription manager (`context: '*'`)
2. Filter for vessel contexts (`vessels.*`) in delta handler
3. Process delta updates with throttling (2-second minimum per vessel)
4. Maintain vessel state with change detection and data validation
5. Filter out invalid vessels (undefined IDs, empty data)

#### Cloud Vessel Integration
1. Periodically fetch nearby vessels from AIS Fleet API (100nm radius)
2. Process cloud vessel data with timestamp comparison against local data
3. Convert cloud data to Signal K format with proper value objects
4. Inject only navigation data (position, speed, course) via Signal K deltas
5. Store cloud vessels in plugin memory with `isCloudVessel` flag
6. Apply throttling (100ms delay every 50 vessels) to prevent WebSocket flooding

#### API Submission
1. Aggregate both local and cloud vessels for submission
2. Submit data in batches of 100 vessels to external API
3. Handle errors with detailed logging and continue processing

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development with debug logging
DEBUG=signalk:plugin:aisfleet npm start

# Link for development
npm link
cd ~/.signalk && npm link aisfleet
```

## Configuration Schema

The plugin uses JSON Schema for configuration:
- `intervalMinutes`: Submission interval (1-15 min, default 5)
- `radiusNauticalMiles`: Cloud vessel fetch radius (10-100 nm, default 100)

Own vessel data is always included for identification purposes.

## Built-in Configuration

- **API Endpoints**:
  - Submission: `https://aisfleet.com/api/vessels/report`
  - Nearby vessels: `https://aisfleet.com/api/vessels/nearby`
- **Authentication**: No API key - uses self MMSI and UUID for identification
- **Request Timeout**: Fixed at 30 seconds
- **Cloud Vessel Radius**: Configurable (10-100 nautical miles, default 100)

## Signal K Integration

- Subscribes to all contexts using `app.subscriptionmanager.subscribe()` with `context: '*'`
- Filters for vessel contexts (`vessels.*`) in delta handler
- Processes delta format updates with timestamp and source information
- Implements throttling (2-second minimum between vessel updates)
- Value change detection to avoid processing duplicate data
- Accesses Signal K app context for self-vessel identification
- Uses Signal K logging (`app.debug`, `app.error`) for consistent output

### Subscription Pattern
```javascript
const vesselSubscription = {
  context: '*',           // All contexts
  subscribe: [{
    path: '*',            // All paths
    period: 5000          // 5-second updates
  }]
};
```

### Data Validation and Filtering
- Filters out vessels with invalid IDs (`undefined`, `null`, empty)
- Removes vessels with no useful data (empty `data` objects)
- Throttles updates to prevent duplicate processing
- Auto-removes stale vessels (>24 hours old)
- Prevents injection of problematic static data (names) that cause schema conflicts

### Cloud Vessel Delta Injection
- **Selective Field Injection**: Only injects changing navigation data (position, speed, course, heading, mmsi)
- **Avoids Static Fields**: Skips vessel names, design info, and other static data to prevent Signal K schema errors
- **Throttled Processing**: 100ms delay every 50 vessels to prevent WebSocket flooding
- **Proper Signal K Format**: Converts cloud data to Signal K value objects with timestamp and source

### Error Handling and Logging
- Minimal, focused debug logs showing key operations
- API query logging with parameters for debugging
- Error categorization (server errors vs network errors)
- Graceful handling of Signal K schema conflicts

## Testing and Deployment

- Plugin designed for installation via Signal K App Store
- Manual installation to `~/.signalk/node_modules`
- Configuration via Signal K admin UI at Server â†’ Plugin Config
- Monitor via Signal K server logs and debug output
