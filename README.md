# MarineHub

A Signal K plugin that monitors AIS vessels, displays them on an interactive web map, and submits their data to an external API at configurable intervals.

## Features

- **Real-time AIS Monitoring**: Tracks all available AIS vessels in the Signal K data stream
- **Interactive Web Map**: Leaflet.js-based map with multiple layers (street map + satellite imagery)
- **Advanced Vessel Classification**: Intelligent AIS ship type detection with distinct vessel categories
- **Closeable Vessel Types Window**: Close and re-open the vessel types legend with dedicated buttons
- **Clickable Category Filtering**: Toggle vessel types on/off by clicking legend items
- **Directional Vessel Icons**: Moving vessels show as arrows with heading, stationary vessels as circles
- **Maritime Coordinate Display**: Proper navigation notation (DDÂ°MM.mmm'N/S/E/W format)
- **Detailed Vessel Information**: Click any vessel for popup with comprehensive vessel details
- **Live Data Updates**: WebSocket connection provides real-time vessel movement
- **Optimized Data Handling**: Simplified data structure without flattening for better performance
- **Configurable Intervals**: Submit data every 1-15 minutes (default: 5 minutes)
- **Automatic Data Management**: Removes vessels that haven't been updated in 24 hours
- **API Integration**: Submits optimized vessel data to MarineHub.ai for analysis
- **Self Identification**: Own vessel data is always included for server identification

### Configuration Settings

- **Submit Interval**: How often to submit data (1-15 minutes, default: 5)

*Note: Own vessel data is always included in submissions for identification purposes.*

## Web Interface

The plugin provides a web-based map interface accessible through the Signal K server:

1. **Access the Map**: Navigate to your Signal K server's web interface
2. **Find MarineHub**: Look for "MarineHub AIS Tracker" in the web apps section
3. **View Vessels**: The map displays all AIS vessels with color-coded icons
4. **Map Initialization**: Starts with world view showing global vessel traffic, then smoothly pans to your vessel's location

### Map Features

- **Dynamic Vessel Icons**:
  - Moving vessels: Directional arrows showing heading
  - Stationary vessels: Small colored circles (SOG < 0.5 knots)
- **Closeable Vessel Types Legend**: Use the close button (Ã—) to hide the legend, then click "Show Vessel Types" to reopen
- **Clickable Legend Filtering**: Click any vessel type in the legend to show/hide that category
- **Enhanced Color Coding**: Distinct colors for all vessel types:
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Pleasure craft
  - ðŸ”´ Dark Red: Sailing vessels
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Cargo vessels
  - ðŸŸ  Dark Orange: Tankers
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: Passenger vessels
  - ðŸŸ¢ Teal: Fishing vessels
  - âš« Dark Blue-Gray: Military vessels
  - ðŸ”˜ Dark Gray: Law enforcement
  - ðŸ”˜ Medium Gray: Pilot vessels
  - ðŸŸ£ Purple: Tug boats
  - ðŸ”˜ Gray: Other vessels
  - ðŸ”˜ Light Gray: Unknown types
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Own vessel

- **Interactive Popups**: Click any vessel to see:
  - Vessel name and MMSI
  - Current position in maritime notation (37Â°46.494'N / 122Â°25.164'W)
  - Course over ground (COG) - only if available
  - Speed over ground (SOG) - only if available
  - Heading - only if available
  - Vessel dimensions (length, beam, draft) - if available
  - Vessel type and call sign
  - Last update time

- **Multiple Map Layers**: Switch between OpenStreetMap and Satellite View via layer control
- **Smart Initialization**: Starts with world view, then smoothly pans to own vessel location
- **Real-time Updates**: Vessels move in real-time as new AIS data arrives
- **Smart Display**: Unknown navigation values are hidden instead of showing "Unknown"
- **Layer Control**: Top-right control allows switching between map and satellite imagery

## API Data Format

The plugin submits optimized vessel data as JSON POST requests to `https://marinehub.ai/api/vessels/report`.

**Timestamp Optimization**: Individual data fields no longer include redundant timestamps. Timing information is provided via:
- Main payload `timestamp` (when report was generated)
- Per-vessel `lastUpdate` (when vessel was last seen)

This reduces payload size significantly while maintaining essential timing information.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "self": {
    "uuid": "urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    "mmsi": "123456789",
    "context": "vessels.self"
  },
  "vessels": [
    {
      "id": "urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:123456789",
      "context": "vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:123456789",
      "lastUpdate": "2025-01-15T10:29:45.000Z",
      "data": {
        "navigation.position": {
          "value": {
            "latitude": 37.7749,
            "longitude": -122.4194
          },
          "source": "ais.0"
        },
        "navigation.courseOverGround": {
          "value": 1.57,
          "source": "ais.0"
        },
        "navigation.speedOverGround": {
          "value": 5.14,
          "source": "ais.0"
        },
        "name": {
          "value": "VESSEL NAME",
          "source": "ais.0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `User-Agent: SignalK-MarineHub/1.0.0`

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging
1. In Signal K admin interface, go to **Server â†’ Settings**
2. Enable "Enable Debug Log"
3. Or set environment variable: `DEBUG=signalk:plugin:marinehub`

### Common Issues

**No vessels appearing**:
- Verify AIS data is being received by Signal K
- Check that vessels appear in the Data Browser
- Ensure plugin is enabled and started

**API submission failures**:
- Check network connectivity to marinehub.ai
- Review server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify Signal K server has valid self identification (MMSI/UUID)

**High memory usage**:
- Plugin automatically removes vessels older than 24 hours
- Consider reducing submission interval for busy areas

### Log Messages

- `Starting MarineHub plugin`: Plugin initialization
- `Updated vessel X with N updates`: Vessel data received
- `Submitting N vessels to API`: API submission attempt
- `Successfully submitted vessel data`: Successful API call
- `API request failed`: Check API endpoint and authentication
